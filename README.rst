WARNING: this is pre alpha code, pretty much a work-in-progress during the Open edX Conference 2016 `hackathon <https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OPEN/Hackathon+the+13th%3A+Part+III>`_.

The goal is to create an extensible, lightweight platform for running online courses, based on the Open edX XBlock runtime.
